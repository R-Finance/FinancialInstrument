#' constructors for synthetic instruments
#' 
#' Simple derivatives like \code{\link{option}} or \code{\link{future}} contracts typically have one underlying instrument.  
#' While properties like strike and expiration vary for these derivative contracts or series, the underlying is well understood.
#' 
#' More complex derivatives are typically modeled as baskets of underlying products, and are typically traded over-the-counter or as proprietary in-house products.
#' 
#' The general \code{synthetic} function is intended to be extended to support these arbitrary baskets of assets.  
#' 
#' Currently implemented examples are in ratio based spreads in \code{spread} and in exchange-guaranteed spread products in \code{guaranteed_spread}.
#' 
#' We welcome assistance from others to model more complex OTC derivatives such as swap products.
#' 
#' @param primary_id string describing the unique ID for the instrument
#' @param currency string describing the currency ID of an object of type \code{\link{currency}}
#' @param multiplier numeric multiplier to apply to the price in the instrument currency to get to notional value
#' @param identifiers character vector of any other identifiers that should also be stored for this instrument
#' @param ... any other passthru parameters 
#' @param type class string, should not be set by users
#' @param members character vector of instrument identifiers that make up the synthetic
#' @param memberratio numeric vector of ratio relationships between members, e.g. c(4,3) for a 4:3 spread
