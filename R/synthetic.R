#' 
#' THIS FUNCTION HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. Use synthetic.instrument instead.
#' Simple derivatives like \code{\link{option}} or \code{\link{future}} contracts typically have one underlying instrument.  
#' While properties like strike and expiration vary for these derivative contracts or series, the underlying is well understood.
#' 
#' More complex derivatives are typically modeled as baskets of underlying products, and are typically traded over-the-counter or as proprietary in-house products.
#' 
#' The general \code{synthetic} function is intended to be extended to support these arbitrary baskets of assets.  
#' 
#' Currently implemented examples are in ratio based spreads in \code{spread} and in exchange-guaranteed spread products in \code{guaranteed_spread}.
#' 
#' We welcome assistance from others to model more complex OTC derivatives such as swap products.

#' synthetic instrument constructors

#' Simple derivatives like \code{\link{option}} or \code{\link{future}} contracts typically have one underlying instrument.  
#' While properties like strike and expiration vary for these derivative contracts or series, the underlying is well understood.

#' The general \code{synthetic} function is intended to be extended to support these arbitrary baskets of assets.  
#' 
#' \code{spread} \code{guaranteed_spread} and \code{butterfly} are wrappers for \code{synthetic.instrument}. \code{synthetic.instrument} will make a call to synthetic to create the final instrument.
#' 
#' The \code{suffix_id} parameter of wrapper functions such as  \code{guaranteed_spread} is presumed to 
#' be a string describing the \code{members}. 
#' It will be \code{\link{strsplit}} using the regex "[-;:_,\\.]" to create the \code{members} vector,
#' and potentially combined with a \code{root_id}.

#' @param currency chr string name of currency denomination
#' @param members vector of primary_ids of member instruments
#' @param memberratio vector of weights for each leg. negative numbers for selling.
#' @param \dots any other passthrough parameters
#' @param multiplier multiplier of the spread
#' @param tick_size minimum price change of the spread
#' @param identifiers identifiers
#' @param type type of instrument; wrappers do not require this.
#' @param root_id instrument identifier for the root contract, default NULL
