#' 
#' THIS FUNCTION HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. Use synthetic.instrument instead.
#' Simple derivatives like \code{\link{option}} or \code{\link{future}} contracts typically have one underlying instrument.  
#' While properties like strike and expiration vary for these derivative contracts or series, the underlying is well understood.
#' 
#' More complex derivatives are typically modeled as baskets of underlying products, and are typically traded over-the-counter or as proprietary in-house products.
#' 
#' The general \code{synthetic} function is intended to be extended to support these arbitrary baskets of assets.  
#' 
#' Currently implemented examples are in ratio based spreads in \code{spread} and in exchange-guaranteed spread products in \code{guaranteed_spread}.
#' 
#' We welcome assistance from others to model more complex OTC derivatives such as swap products.

#' @param primary_id string describing the unique ID for the instrument
