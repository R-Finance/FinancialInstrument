\value{
  an object of class \sQuote{suffix.list} which is a list

  price of option, \sQuote{right} of option (\dQuote{C} or

  These would be recognized as a Sep 2011 outright futures
  contract: U1, U11, SEP1, SEP11, U2011, Sep2011, SEP2011

  These would be recognized as a call with a strike of
  122.5 that expires Sep 17, 2011: 110917C122.5,
  20110917C122.5

  These would be recognized as Sep 2011 single stock
  futures: 1CU1, 1CU11, 1CSEP11, 1DU1 (dividend protected)

  These would be recognized as Adjusted futures: cm.30 (30
  day constant maturity future), cc.OI (continuous contract
  rolled when Open Interest rolls), cc.Vol (continuous
  contract roll when Volumn rolls), cc.Exp.1 (continuous
  contract rolled 1 day before Expiration)

  Synthetics only return a value for the $type slot: U1.Z1
  --> type == calendar, spread; U11.Z11 --> type ==
  calendar, spread; SPY.DIA --> type == synthetic;
  110917C125.110917P125 --> type == option_spread, spread
}
