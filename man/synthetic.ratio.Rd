\usage{
  synthetic.ratio(primary_id, currency, members,
  memberratio, ..., multiplier = 1, identifiers = NULL,
  type = c("synthetic.ratio", "synthetic", "instrument"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{primary_id}{string describing the unique ID for the
  instrument}

  \item{currency}{string describing the currency ID of an
  object of type \code{\link{currency}}}

  \item{multiplier}{numeric multiplier to apply to the
  price in the instrument currency to get to notional
  value}

  \item{identifiers}{character vector of any other
  identifiers that should also be stored for this
  instrument}

  \item{...}{any other passthru parameters}

  \item{type}{class string, should not be set by users}

  \item{members}{character vector of instrument identifiers
  that make up the synthetic}

  \item{memberratio}{numeric vector of ratio relationships
  between members, e.g. c(4,3) for a 4:3 spread}

  \item{tick_size}{the tick increment of the instrument
  price in it's trading venue, as numeric quantity (e.g.
  1/8 is .125)}
}
\description{
  THIS FUNCTION HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. Use
  synthetic.instrument instead. Simple derivatives like
  \code{\link{option}} or \code{\link{future}} contracts
  typically have one underlying instrument. While
  properties like strike and expiration vary for these
  derivative contracts or series, the underlying is well
  understood.
}
\details{
  More complex derivatives are typically modeled as baskets
  of underlying products, and are typically traded
  over-the-counter or as proprietary in-house products.

  The general \code{synthetic} function is intended to be
  extended to support these arbitrary baskets of assets.

  Currently implemented examples are in ratio based spreads
  in \code{spread} and in exchange-guaranteed spread
  products in \code{guaranteed_spread}.

  We welcome assistance from others to model more complex
  OTC derivatives such as swap products.
