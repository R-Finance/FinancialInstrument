Changes in Version 1.1
======================

NEW FEATURES

* sort.instrument() method to sort the components of an instrument

* CompareInstrumentFiles() allows passing it only 1 argument in which case it
  will compare the currently loaded instrument environment against it.

BUG FIXES

* import xts to prevent xts functions from being masked.

* ls_instruments_by() checks for NA to avoid an error.

* force evaluation of arguments to CompareInstrumentEnvironment()

* option_series.yahoo() checks the results of the call to 
  quantmod::getOptionChain() and only uses rows that contain the ticker Symbol
  (sometimes in the off-hours, yahoo includes a bad row)

* update_instruments.morningstar is slightly more robust.  It no longer 
  depends on the relevant table being the 4th on the page; instead it uses
  the table with the most rows.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

* minor updates to docs: typo fixes, updated seealso sections
