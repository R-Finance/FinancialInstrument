****************************
** Changes in Version 1.1 **
****************************
NEW FEATURES
  o sort.instrument() method to sort the components of an instrument
  o CompareInstrumentFiles() allows passing it only 1 argument in which case it
    will compare the currently loaded instrument environment against it.

BUG FIXES
  o import xts to prevent xts functions from being masked.
  o ls_instruments_by() checks for NA to avoid an error.
  o force evaluation of arguments to CompareInstrumentEnvironment()
  o option_series.yahoo() checks the results of the call to 
    quantmod::getOptionChain() and only uses rows that contain the ticker Symbol
    (sometimes in the off-hours, yahoo includes a bad row)
  o update_instruments.morningstar is slightly more robust.  It no longer 
    depends on the relevant table being the 4th on the page; instead it uses
    the table with the most rows.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES
