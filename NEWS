Changes in Version 1.2
======================

BUG FIXES
---------

* If the end of dir was the same as Symbol, getSymbols.FI had trouble finding 
  the files.  Test added.

TESTS
-----

* Now using testthat for package testing


Changes in Version 1.1
======================

NEW FEATURES
------------

* sort.instrument() method to sort the components of an instrument

* CompareInstrumentFiles() allows passing it only 1 argument in which case it
  will compare the currently loaded instrument environment against it.

* If an instrument has a string like "2012-09", "2012/09", or "201209" in the
  "expires" attribute, sort_id() will treat that instrument as expiring on the
  first day of that month (2012-09-01).  Thanks to Jan Humme for reporting.

BUG FIXES
---------

* import xts to prevent xts functions from being masked.

* ls_instruments_by() checks for NA to avoid an error.

* force evaluation of arguments to CompareInstrumentEnvironment()

* option_series.yahoo() checks the results of the call to 
  quantmod::getOptionChain() and only uses rows that contain the ticker Symbol
  (sometimes in the off-hours, yahoo includes a bad row)

* update_instruments.morningstar is slightly more robust.  It no longer 
  depends on the relevant table being the 4th on the page; instead it uses
  the table with the most rows.

* Replace paste0() calls with paste() so that R 2.15 in not required.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES
--------------------

* If use_identifier is not NA in a call to getSymbols.FI, and the instrument
  cannot be found, there is a more informative error message.

* minor updates to docs: typo fixes, updated seealso sections

SANDBOX
-------

* The download.TrueFX.R script can now be called with Rscript. It accepts a 
  trailing argument to specify the number of cores to use.
